-Fetches a URL from https://goqr.me/ (respect their terms and rights) and via an input field, it then generates (if the user pasted or wrote a proper URL) a QR based on said field's value. QRs can also be downloaded and used for personal use.
This input field is a type of "url" and will not allow ordinary words, only URLs, which further prevents creating faulty QRs.
